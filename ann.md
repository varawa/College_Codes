Here are the main types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):

1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
   - Simplest form, information flows in one direction

2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
   - Specialized for processing grid-like data, such as images

3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
   - Handle sequential data, have loops to maintain information

4. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
   - A type of RNN designed to handle long-term dependencies

5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
   - Consist of two networks competing to generate new data

6. Autoencoders
   - Learn efficient data representations unsupervised

7. Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN)
   - Use radial basis functions as activation functions

8. Hopfield Network
   - Recurrent neural network with binary threshold nodes

9. Boltzmann Machine
   - Stochastic recurrent neural network

10. Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
    - Composed of multiple layers of latent variables
