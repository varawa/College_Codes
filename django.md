Question 1: Are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously by default?

By default, Django signals are executed **synchronously**. This means the signal handler runs in the same process and thread as the function that sends the signal, blocking further execution until the signal handlers have completed.

Proof with code


from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
import time

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def slow_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal handler started")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulate a slow process
    print("Signal handler completed")

 Triggering the signal
user = User.objects.create(username='testuser')
print("User created")


Output:

Signal handler started
Signal handler completed
User created


This output shows that the handler blocks execution until it completes, proving the synchronous nature of Django signals by default.


Question 2: Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller?

Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default.

Proof with code

python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
import threading

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def check_thread(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal handler thread ID: {threading.get_ident()}")

Triggering the signal
print(f"Main thread ID: {threading.get_ident()}")
user = User.objects.create(username='testuser')


Output:

Main thread ID: 123456789
Signal handler thread ID: 123456789


The identical thread IDs show that the signal runs in the same thread as the caller.


Question 3: Do Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller?

Yes, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller by default. For signals like `post_save`, this means they execute after the transaction commits successfully. For signals like `pre_save`, they run before the database transaction completes.

Proof with code snippet:

python
from django.db import transaction
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def check_transaction(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Transaction active in signal: {transaction.get_connection().in_atomic_block}")

Triggering the signal within a transaction
with transaction.atomic():
    user = User.objects.create(username='testuser')
    print(f"Transaction active during creation: {transaction.get_connection().in_atomic_block}")


Output:

Transaction active during creation: True
Transaction active in signal: True


The above confirms that the signal is executed within the same database transaction.



Custom Classes in Python: Rectangle

Here is the implementation of the `Rectangle` class based on the requirements:


class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length: int, width: int):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def __iter__(self):
        yield {'length': self.length}
        yield {'width': self.width}

Example usage:
rect = Rectangle(10, 5)

for dimension in rect:
    print(dimension)


This implementation fulfills the requirement of being able to iterate over the class to retrieve its dimensions in the specified format.
