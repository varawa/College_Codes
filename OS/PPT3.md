    a. abstracts physical properties to logical storage unit.
    b. Each medium is controlled by device(i.e., disk drivers, tape drivers)
        Varying properties include access speed, capacity, data-transfer rate, access methos(sequential or random).

2. File System Management-
    a. files usually organized into directories.
    b. access control on most systems to determine who can access what stuff.
    c. OS activities include-
        creating/deleting files and dir
        primitives to manipulate dirs
        mapping files onto secondary storage
        backup files onto stable(non-volatile) storage media.
