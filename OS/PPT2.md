User Mode vs Kernel Mode-
    1. Privileges: User mode is restricted and limited, while kernel mode has full access and control over the system.
    2. Purpose: User mode is for running user applications, whereas kernel mode is for executing core OS functions.
    3. Protection: User mode operations are isolated from the systemâ€™s core, reducing the risk of damage. Kernel mode operations have no such isolation, which is why careful management is essential.
    4. Error Handling: Errors in user mode generally only affect the running process, whereas errors in kernel mode can have system-wide consequences.

Kernel-
    The core part of an OS, manages system resources and provides essential services.

Operating system operations-
    1. Bootstrap program-
        Simple code to initialize the system, load the kernel.
    2. Kernel Loads
    3. Starts system daemons(services provided outside of the kernel).
    4. Kernel interrupt drivenoperation(h/w and s/w)-
        a. Hardware interrupt by one of the devices.
        b. Software interrupt(exception or trap)
            1. software error(divided by zero)
            2. request for OS service- system call
            (When a system call is made, it intentionally triggers a trap to transition from user mode to kernel mode, where the operating system can safely execute privileged instructions. This trap is a controlled way for the OS to take over execution and perform the requested service.)
            3. Others are infinite loops and stuff
