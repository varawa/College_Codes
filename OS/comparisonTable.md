| Feature | Simple Batch System | Multiprogramming System | Time Sharing System | Parallel System | Distributed System | Real-Time System |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Definition** | Executes jobs without user interaction | Runs multiple programs concurrently on a single CPU | Allows multiple users to interact with the system simultaneously | Uses multiple processors to run multiple computations | Coordinates multiple independent computers to appear as a single system | Guarantees a response within specific time constraints |
| **User Interaction** | No interaction during execution | Limited interaction | Interactive | Can be interactive or batch | Interactive | Often interactive, sometimes automated |
| **CPU Utilization** | Low to moderate | High | High | Very high | High across multiple machines | Varies, often high |
| **Response Time** | High (hours or days) | Moderate | Low (seconds) | Low to very low | Can vary | Guaranteed within deadlines |
| **Resource Sharing** | Sequential | Concurrent | Concurrent with time slices | Parallel | Distributed across network | Often dedicated resources |
| **Complexity** | Low | Moderate | High | Very high | Extremely high | High |
| **Scheduling** | Simple, often FIFO | Priority or round-robin | Round-robin with small time quanta | Complex, often task-dependent | Distributed scheduling algorithms | Priority-based, deadline-driven |
| **Memory Management** | Simple partitioning | Memory partitioning or paging | Virtual memory, paging | Shared or distributed memory | Distributed memory management | Often uses real-time memory allocation |
| **Main Goal** | Maximize throughput | Maximize CPU usage | Minimize response time | Maximize parallel processing | Scalability and resource sharing | Meet time constraints |
| **Typical Use Case** | Payroll processing, scientific batch jobs | General-purpose computing | Interactive computing, development | Scientific simulations, rendering | Cloud computing, web services | Industrial control, aviation systems |
