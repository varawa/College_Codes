Here are some basic points on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):

1. Sequential data processing: RNNs are designed to work with sequential data, making them suitable for tasks like natural language processing and time series analysis.

2. Memory capability: Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs have a form of memory, allowing them to consider previous inputs when processing current data.

3. Recurrent connections: RNNs have loops in their architecture, enabling information to persist across multiple time steps.

4. Shared parameters: RNNs use the same weights across all time steps, reducing the number of parameters to learn.

5. Vanishing/exploding gradients: Traditional RNNs can struggle with long-term dependencies due to these gradient problems during training.

6. Variants: To address limitations, variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks were developed.

7. Applications: RNNs are used in speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and music generation, among other areas.
